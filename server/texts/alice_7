By this time, Alice had found her way into a tidy little room with a
table in the window, and on it a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white
kid-gloves; she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves and was just
going to leave the room, when her eyes fell upon a little bottle that
stood near the looking-glass. She uncorked it and put it to her lips,
saying to herself, "I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for,
really, I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!"
