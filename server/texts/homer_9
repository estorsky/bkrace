in the depths of the sea hard by the old man her father. Forthwith she
rose as it were a grey mist out of the waves, sat down before him as he
stood weeping, caressed him with her hand, and said, "My son, why are you
weeping? What is it that grieves you? Keep it not from me, but tell me,
that we may know it together."
